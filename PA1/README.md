# INSTRUCTIONS:

Open the Jupyter Notebook - crawler.ipynb.

Run all cells - the last one will start the crawler - make sure to update the IP address to your local database (or any function call with the argument "conn" to disable pushing data to a database) 

This is an updated version of our crawler which requires three text files to run - frontier.txt, domains.txt and visited.txt. These files store data used by the crawler, and they update every hour.

# DATABASE:

Due to limitations imposed on file size, we uploaded the database to Google Drive. [It is available here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c15MP7ouNpXH9acF17XbodDHNpdBRbpU?usp=sharing)
